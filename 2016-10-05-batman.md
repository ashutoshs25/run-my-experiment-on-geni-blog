This experiment shows how to use [B.A.T.M.A.N.](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Wiki), a (dynamic) routing protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. You will see how routes in a wireless mesh network change over time as nodes enter or leave the network.

It should take about 60 minutes to run this experiment, but you will need to have reserved this time in advance. The experiment uses wireless resources, and you can only use wireless resources on GENI during a reservation. You can reserve any one of these testbeds for this experiment: the [WITest](https://witestlab.poly.edu) testbed, the "outdoor" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org), the "sb4" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org), or the "grid" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org). (This experiment requires four nodes with compatible wireless cards; these testbeds meet that requirement.)

In order to reproduce this experiment on GENI, you will need an account on the [GENI Portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/SignMeUp), and you will need to have joined a project. You should have already [uploaded your SSH keys to the portal](http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/HowTo/LoginToNodes). The project lead of the project you belong to must have [enabled wireless for the project](https://portal.geni.net/secure/wimax-enable.php). Finally, you must have [reserved time on one of those four wireless testbeds, and you must run this experiment during your reserved time.


## Background

[BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki/BATMANConcept) is a proactive link-state based routing protocol that aims to offer a Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking. It is designed for lossy and unstructured multi-hop mesh networks.

BATMAN nodes don't have to calculate the whole routes for their outgoing packets, and they don't have to know the full topology of the mesh network. In BATMAN, all nodes periodically broadcasts "hello" signals, also known as originator messages (OGM), to its neighbors. Each originator messages consists of an originator address, a sending node address and a unique sequence number. When an OGM is received, the receiving node changes the sending address to its own address and re-broadcasts the message. The sequence number is used to identify which of a pair of messages is newer. With this process, each node in the network learns its own direct neighbors, but also learns about _other_ nodes that are not in range through a direct link but can be reached by hopping through a neighbor.


Each BATMAN node maintains an [originator table](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Understand-your-batman-adv-network) which lists the addresses of all other reachable nodes in the network. An estimation metric (TQ) is used to evaluate the link transmit quality between an originator node and a destination node. Each address entry in the originator table is assigned a TQ metric. The value of TQ metric rank is defined on a scale between 0 and 255 (0 indicating no connection and 255 being excellent link quality). When a data packet arrives for transmission, the node refers to the originator table to determine the direction in which the packets are to be sent. Specifically, it checks its originator table and forwards the packet towards the destination with the highest rank entry - the best next neighbor.

When a node enters or leaves the network, or when a link fails or is degraded, this will be reflected in the TQ metric and the node/link will be avoided if a better path is available.

BATMAN nodes do not maintain the full route to every destination. Each node along the route only maintains the information about the best next neighbor through which it finds the [best route](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki/Routing_scenarios). So the complete topology is not known to any single node, and topology and routing decisions are distributed among all the nodes.


## Results

In this experiment we show how link quality is estimated and how routes are formed depending on the link quality ranks (TQ). The topology that we are going to use is the following.

![](/blog/content/images/2017/06/batman-topology.svg)

First we see how link ranks are formed and which link route is chosen at that time.

Then, we start introducing failures in the link between Relay A and the source and destination nodes, and see how the link rank drops over time and how the route is switching between the two links.

![](/blog/content/images/2017/06/RankA_declining-1.svg)

Next, we stop the failures and see how the rank of the link recovers.

![](/blog/content/images/2017/06/RankA_recovering.svg)

When the link rank has recovered, we introduce failures to the link between Relay B and the source and destination nodes

![](/blog/content/images/2017/06/RankB_declining.svg)

Finally, we stop the failures again and see how the rank of Relay B recovers.

## Run my experiment

In order to run this experiment, we should have a reservation on one of four GENI wireless testbeds:

 * the [WITest](https://witestlab.poly.edu) testbed, 
 * the "outdoor" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org), 
 * the "sb4" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org), 
 * or the "grid" testbed on [ORBIT](https://geni.orbit-lab.org). 

(This experiment requires four nodes with Atheros 9XXX wireless cards; these testbeds meet that requirement.)

This experiment can also run on the indoor testbed at [NITOS](http://nitos.inf.uth.gr/), although you will need a separate account to use it (GENI accounts are not supported there).


Depending on which testbed you have reserved, you should follow the corresponding instructions to set up the testbed:

 * [Set up WITest](#setupwitest)
 * [Set up outdoor](#setupoutdoor)
 * [Set up sb4](#setupsb4)
 * [Set up grid](#setupgrid)
 * [Set up NITOS](#setupnitos)

#### Set up WITest

At your reserved time, log in to the testbed using your GENI wireless username and keys:

```
ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY USERNAME@witestlab.poly.edu
```

Note that your GENI wireless username has a "geni-" prefix.

Identify four nodes that have Atheros 9XXX cards. In these instructions we will use node16,node17,node18,node19 if you are using WITest. But if one of these nodes is unavailable, you may replace it with another Atheros 9XXX-equipped node - any of the nodes from node16-node25.

Once we have logged in to the testbed console and identified four nodes that are available for use in this experiment, we load the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image onto the nodes:

```
omf-5.4 load -i mesh-protocols.ndz -t omf.witest.node16,omf.witest.node17,omf.witest.node18,omf.witest.node19
```

(note that this is all one line, and there are no spaces around the commas).
s
After the disk image process has finished, we should ensure that all 4 nodes have been successfully imaged and we got a message like the following.

```
-----------------------------
Imaging Process Done
4 nodes successfully imaged
-----------------------------
```

If some nodes are not imaged (e.g. they do not "check in" to the experiment, or they "time out"), repeat the imaging process on just the individual nodes that failed.

Then, turn on your nodes:

```
omf tell -a on -t omf.witest.node16,omf.witest.node17,omf.witest.node18,omf.witest.node19
```

After turning the nodes on, wait a few minutes for them to boot. Then, open _four_ SSH sessions to your testbed console. In each, SSH in to another one of the four nodes as the root user, e.g. "ssh root@node16" in one session, "ssh root@node17" in the next, etc.

Then, go on to [set up the network](#setupnetwork).

#### Set up outdoor

At your reserved time, log in to the testbed using your GENI wireless username and keys:

```
ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY USERNAME@outdoor.orbit-lab.org
```

Note that your GENI wireless username has a "geni-" prefix.

Identify four nodes that have Atheros 9XXX cards. In these instructions we will use node1-2,node1-3,node1-4,node1-5 if you are using outdoor. But if one of these nodes is unavailable, you may replace it with another Atheros 9XXX-equipped node. To find these, visit the [control panel](https://www.geni.orbit-lab.org/cPanel/controlPanel/start) on the ORBIT website. Click on "Status Page" and then the "outdoor" tab.  Use the panels on the left side, find the "ath9k" setting under "WiFi" and check it; nodes with that hardware will be marked with an "X".

Once we have logged in to the testbed console and identified four nodes that are available for use in this experiment, we load the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image onto the nodes:

```
omf load -i mesh-protocols.ndz -t node1-2.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-3.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-4.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-5.outdoor.orbit-lab.org
```

(note that this is all one line, and there are no spaces around the commas).

After the disk image process has finished, we should ensure that all 4 nodes have been successfully imaged and we got a message like the following.

```
-----------------------------
Imaging Process Done
4 nodes successfully imaged
-----------------------------
```

If some nodes are not imaged (e.g. they do not "check in" to the experiment, or they "time out"), repeat the imaging process on just the individual nodes that failed.

Then, turn on your nodes:

```
omf tell -a on -t node1-2.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-3.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-4.outdoor.orbit-lab.org,node1-5.outdoor.orbit-lab.org
```

After turning the nodes on, wait a few minutes for them to boot. Then, open _four_ SSH sessions to your testbed console. In each, SSH in to another one of the four nodes as the root user, e.g. "ssh root@node1-2" in one session, "ssh root@node1-3" in the next, etc.

Then, go on to [set up the network](#setupnetwork).


#### Set up sb4

At your reserved time, log in to the testbed using your GENI wireless username and keys:

```
ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY USERNAME@sb4.orbit-lab.org
```

Note that your GENI wireless username has a "geni-" prefix.

When you first log in to the "sb4" console, you should reset sb4's [programmable attenuation matrix](http://www.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Hardware/bDomains/cSandboxes/dSB4) to zero attenuation between all pairs of nodes. From the "sb4" console, run

```
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/setAll?att=0"


wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=1&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=2&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=3&port=1"  
wget -qO- "http://internal2dmz.orbit-lab.org:5054/instr/selDevice?switch=4&port=1"  
```

Next, identify four nodes that have Atheros 9XXX cards. In these instructions we will use node1-3,node1-4,node1-5,node1-6 if you are using sb4. But if one of these nodes is unavailable, you may replace it with another Atheros 9XXX-equipped node. To find these, visit the [control panel](https://www.geni.orbit-lab.org/cPanel/controlPanel/start) on the ORBIT website. Click on "Status Page" and then the "sb4" tab.  Use the panels on the left side, find the "ath9k" setting under "WiFi" and check it; nodes with that hardware will be marked with an "X".

Once we have logged in to the testbed console and identified four nodes that are available for use in this experiment, we load the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image onto the nodes:

```
omf load -i mesh-protocols.ndz -t node1-3.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-4.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-5.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-6.sb4.orbit-lab.org
```

(note that this is all one line, and there are no spaces around the commas).

After the disk image process has finished, we should ensure that all 4 nodes have been successfully imaged and we got a message like the following.

```
-----------------------------
Imaging Process Done
4 nodes successfully imaged
-----------------------------
```

If some nodes are not imaged (e.g. they do not "check in" to the experiment, or they "time out"), repeat the imaging process on just the individual nodes that failed.

Then, turn on your nodes:

```
omf tell -a on -t node1-3.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-4.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-5.sb4.orbit-lab.org,node1-6.sb4.orbit-lab.org
```

After turning the nodes on, wait a few minutes for them to boot. Then, open _four_ SSH sessions to your testbed console. In each, SSH in to another one of the four nodes as the root user, e.g. "ssh root@node1-3" in one session, "ssh root@node1-4" in the next, etc.

Then, go on to [set up the network](#setupnetwork).

#### Set up grid

At your reserved time, log in to the testbed using your GENI wireless username and keys:

```
ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY USERNAME@grid.orbit-lab.org
```

Note that your GENI wireless username has a "geni-" prefix.

Identify four nodes that have Atheros 9XXX cards. In these instructions we will use node2-7,node2-8,node2-9,node2-10 if you are using the grid. But if one of these nodes is unavailable, you may replace it with another Atheros 9XXX-equipped node. To find these, visit the [control panel](https://www.geni.orbit-lab.org/cPanel/controlPanel/start) on the ORBIT website. Click on "Status Page" and then the "grid" tab.  Use the panels on the left side, find the "ath9k" setting under "WiFi" and check it; nodes with that hardware will be marked with an "X".

Once we have logged in to the testbed console and identified four nodes that are available for use in this experiment, we load the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image onto the nodes:

```
omf load -i mesh-protocols.ndz -t node2-7.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-8.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-9.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-10.grid.orbit-lab.org
```

(note that this is all one line, and there are no spaces around the commas).

After the disk image process has finished, we should ensure that all 4 nodes have been successfully imaged and we got a message like the following.

```
-----------------------------
Imaging Process Done
4 nodes successfully imaged
-----------------------------
```

If some nodes are not imaged (e.g. they do not "check in" to the experiment, or they "time out"), repeat the imaging process on just the individual nodes that failed.

Then, turn on your nodes:

```
omf tell -a on -t node2-7.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-8.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-9.grid.orbit-lab.org,node2-10.grid.orbit-lab.org
```

After turning the nodes on, wait a few minutes for them to boot. Then, open _four_ SSH sessions to your testbed console. In each, SSH in to another one of the four nodes as the root user, e.g. "ssh root@node2-7" in one session, "ssh root@node2-8" in the next, etc.

Then, go on to [set up the network](#setupnetwork).

#### Set up NITOS

At your reserved time, log in to the testbed using your NITOS slice name and keys:

```
ssh -i /PATH/TO/KEY slice_name@nitlab3.inf.uth.gr
```

Identify four nodes that have Atheros 9XXX cards. In these instructions we will use node054,node055,node058,node059 if you are using NITOS. But if one of these nodes is unavailable, you may replace it with another Atheros 9XXX-equipped node - for example, you may use any of the nodes node054-node056, node058-node060, node062-node064.

Once we have logged in to the testbed console and identified four nodes that are available for use in this experiment, we load the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image onto the nodes:

```
omf load -i mesh-protocols.ndz -t node054,node055,node058,node059
```

(note that this is all one line, and there are no spaces around the commas).

After the disk image process has finished, we should ensure that all 4 nodes have been successfully imaged and we got a message like the following.

```
-----------------------------
Imaging Process Done
4 nodes successfully imaged
-----------------------------
```

If some nodes are not imaged (e.g. they do not "check in" to the experiment, or they "time out"), repeat the imaging process on just the individual nodes that failed.

Then, turn on your nodes:

```
omf tell -a on -t node054,node055,node058,node059
```

After turning the nodes on, wait a few minutes for them to boot. Then, open _four_ SSH sessions to your testbed console. In each, SSH in to another one of the four nodes as the root user, e.g. `ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" root@node054` in one session, `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking no" root@node055` in the next, etc.

Then, go on to [set up the network](#setupnetwork).

### Set up network

Now, we will set up a mesh network with B.A.T.M.A.N.

On each node run:

```
modprobe ath9k
modprobe ath5k
```

to load the wireless driver. Then, run

```
ifconfig wlan0 up
ifconfig wlan0 0.0.0.0 down
ifconfig wlan0 mtu 1532
iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc essid batman-mesh ap 43:5F:6B:88:A7:CF channel 11
```

to set up a mesh network (at layer 2). You can run

```
iwconfig wlan0
```

to verify layer 2 connectivity. If connected, the output should look like this:

```
wlan0     IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:"batman-mesh"  
          Mode:Ad-Hoc  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Cell: 43:5F:6B:88:A7:CF   
          Tx-Power=27 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
```


Afer we set up a mesh network at Layer 2, we will set up a bridge on each node WLAN interface:

```
modprobe bridge

brctl addbr mesh0
brctl addif mesh0 wlan0
```

The purpose of the bridge is to make it possible to filter MAC addresses in a later step, so that we can force arbitrary topologies on the mesh.

Now, we set up the [B.A.T.M.A.N. routing protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N.) on this mesh. On each node, run:

```
modprobe batman-adv
batctl if add mesh0

sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


# Set up IP address
x=$(ifconfig | awk '/inet addr/{print substr($2,6)}' | head -n 1 | cut -f3 -d'.')
y=$(ifconfig | awk '/inet addr/{print substr($2,6)}' | head -n 1 | cut -f4 -d'.')

ifconfig mesh0 up
ifconfig wlan0 up
ifconfig bat0 192.168.$x.$y netmask 255.255.0.0
```

Wait a few minutes for the B.A.T.M.A.N. messages to propagate through the network. Then, you can find out what neighbors each node can "see" by running

```
batctl n
```

on each node. You should be able to verify that each node can "see" exactly three neighbors, e.g.

```
[B.A.T.M.A.N. adv 2017.0, MainIF/MAC: mesh0/00:60:b3:25:c0:3a (bat0/de:ec:6a:4f:b9:a7 BATMAN_IV)]
IF             Neighbor              last-seen
mesh0   00:0c:42:64:b1:e6    0.736s
mesh0   00:0c:42:64:b0:28    0.928s
mesh0   00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2    0.016s
```


### Force use of a relay

Of the four nodes in your experiment, choose two to be "end nodes" (one "source" and one "destination") and two to be intermediate relays ("relayA" and "relayB"). We will configure the end nodes so that they do not have a direct link between them (we will use `ebtables` to block direct communication). Thus, when end nodes want to communicate, they send their packets through relay nodes and those respectively forward those packets to the final destination.

This topology is shown here:

![](/blog/content/images/2017/06/batman-topology.svg)

In our current setup, all nodes are able to communicate directly with each other. We will use `ebtables` to implement the topology of the figure instead.

On the node that you have designated as the "destination", run `ifconfig | grep wlan0` and note its wireless interface MAC address. The output of the command should look something like this:

```
wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0c:42:64:b1:e6
```

Now, on the designated "source" node, we will apply filtering to block it from receiving any messages (including OGM messages) that were sent from this MAC address. On the "source" node, run:

```
MAC=00:0c:42:64:b1:e6  # use MAC address of destination

ebtables -A FORWARD -s $MAC -j DROP
ebtables -A INPUT   -s $MAC -j DROP
ebtables -A OUTPUT  -s $MAC -j DROP
```

but replace the MAC address in the first line with the MAC address of _your_ "destination" node.

Similarly, get the MAC address of the "source" node and, on the destination node, block its messages. On the "destination" node run:

```
MAC=00:0c:42:64:b1:e6  # use MAC address of source node

ebtables -A FORWARD -s $MAC -j DROP
ebtables -A INPUT   -s $MAC -j DROP
ebtables -A OUTPUT  -s $MAC -j DROP
```

At this point you should verify that the path from source to destination goes through one of the relays. On the "source" node, run

```
batctl traceroute DESTIP
```

where the last argument is the IP address of the "destination" node. (Use `ifconfig bat0` on the "destination" node to find out its IP address.) You should see an intermediate hop through a relay node in the traceroute output. (You may have to wait a few moments for the protocol to realize that the link between source and destination is no longer available, and to adjust the routes.)


### Introducing failures in the network

In this experiment we want to examine network links and their ranks depending on the BATMAN protocol evaluation. We also want to examine how the ranks and the network routing behaviour is affected when the conditions on those links change. To do this, we monitor the originator table of BATMAN protocol on nodes, over time.

On the "source" node, run the command 

```
batctl o
``` 
to see the originator table of this node. This table helps us understand to which neighbor a packet is forwarded. 

Here is an example of an originator table:

```
[B.A.T.M.A.N. adv 2017.0, MainIF/MAC: mesh0/00:60:b3:25:c0:3a (bat0/36:56:9c:37:ac:79 BATMAN_IV)]
   Originator        last-seen (#/255) Nexthop           [outgoingIF]
   00:0c:42:64:b0:28    0.060s   (206) 00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2 [     mesh0]
 * 00:0c:42:64:b0:28    0.060s   (251) 00:0c:42:64:b0:28 [     mesh0]
   00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2    0.132s   (216) 00:0c:42:64:b0:28 [     mesh0]
 * 00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2    0.132s   (247) 00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2 [     mesh0]
   00:0c:42:64:b1:e6    0.096s   (208) 00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2 [     mesh0]
 * 00:0c:42:64:b1:e6    0.096s   (221) 00:0c:42:64:b0:28 [     mesh0]
```

when the MAC addresses of the nodes in the network are:

<table>
<tr><td>source</td><td>00:60:b3:25:c0:3a</td></tr>
<tr><td>relayA</td><td>00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2</td></tr>
<tr><td>relayB</td><td> 00:0c:42:64:b0:28</td></tr>
<tr><td>destination</td><td>00:0c:42:64:b1:e6</td></tr>
</table>


In the first column of the originator table, it shows the MAC address of the originator node. Then, it shows when that node was last seen on the network. Next, it shows the link quality rank (#/255) of the path to that originator through each possible next hop - the MAC address of the next hop is in the fourth column. In the example above, the MAC addresses of the nodes are:

We can see that the route from source node (00:60:b3:25:c0:3a) to destination node (00:0c:42:64:b1:e6), uses relay B (00:0c:42:64:b0:28) as an intermediate hop for its transmission, and the rank of this path is 221. We can also see that routes to 00:0c:42:3a:b6:c2 and 00:0c:42:64:b0:28 (the relays) are direct links and no intermediate hops are used for them. Their respective ranks are 247 and 251.

For a better understanding of BATMAN routing we will examine how these next-hop decisions and the estimated link quality are affected over time for when a link fails or recovers from a failure.

For convenience, we have written a script for real time monitoring of originator table links to destination node, available in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/cmanolidis/0a5dc21874cc9d31012e758eb8d67ca5). On the source node, we download the script:

```
wget -O relay-ranks-monitoring.sh https://git.io/vHiMN
```

Then run this script it on the source node. (In the command, use the MAC addresses of the destination, relay A, and relay B nodes, respectively. For the last argument, use the filename to which you want to save the results.)

```
bash relay-ranks-monitoring.sh DEST_MAC RELAY_A_MAC RELAY_B_MAC batman-no-failure.csv
```

The script will show the entries (next hops and rank) in the originator table for paths to the destination node, and will update every second. The output of the script will be something like this:

```
  originator(MAC)  rank(hop-A)  rank(hop-B)  time(sec)
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6        217         217        0
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6        217         216        1
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6        217         215        2
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6        217         214        3
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6        217         212        4
...
```

(Press `Ctl+C` to stop the script execution.)


Now we will see the behaviour of the link from source to destination node through Relay A, when the link into Relay A from the end nodes is down. On the source node we run the following command:

```
bash relay-ranks-monitoring.sh DEST_MAC RELAY_A_MAC RELAY_B_MAC batman-relay-a-failure.csv
```

While this is running, on Relay A run:

```

where you specify the MAC address of the source and destination nodes in the first two lines.


On the output, we can see that link ranks through Relay A start dropping.

```
  originator(MAC)  rank(hop-A)  rank(hop-B)  time(sec)
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         192         190         0
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         191         189         1
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         191         188         2
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         191         190         3
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         190         191         4
...

00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         105         191         33
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         102         191         34
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         101         193         35
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         99          195         36
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         0           195         37
```

After some time, the ranks of the link facing failures drop to zero. We stop the execution of the script (`ctl+c`) and wait for one minute.

Now, we will see how this links recovers when we stop the failures. On the source node, we execute again the script by giving the commands:

```
bash relay-ranks-monitoring.sh DEST_MAC RELAY_A_MAC RELAY_B_MAC batman-relay-a-recovery.csv
```


On Relay A, we run the command:

```
ebtables -F
```

On source node, we can see the link ranks through Relay A recovering:


```
  originator(MAC)  rank(hop-A)  rank(hop-B)  time(sec)
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         100         198         0
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         102         198         1
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         104         197         2
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         107         195         3
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         111         194         4
...

00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         192         194         36
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         193         194         37
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         194         194         38
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         194         193         39
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         195         191         40
```

When the Relay A links recover, we press `ctl+c` and stop the script.


Now we repeat the same process for the link ranks of the _Relay B_. First we introduce some link failures. On the source node run:

```
bash relay-ranks-monitoring.sh DEST_MAC RELAY_A_MAC RELAY_B_MAC batman-relay-b-failures.csv
```

Next on Relay B:

```
SOURCE=SOURCE_MAC
DESTINATION=DEST_MAC

ebtables -A FORWARD -s $SOURCE -j DROP
ebtables -A INPUT   -s $SOURCE -j DROP
ebtables -A OUTPUT  -s $SOURCE -j DROP
ebtables -A FORWARD -s $DESTINATION -j DROP
ebtables -A INPUT   -s $DESTINATION -j DROP
ebtables -A OUTPUT  -s $DESTINATION -j DROP
```

We notice on source that ranks of paths through Relay B start dropping.


```
  originator(MAC)  rank(hop-A)  rank(hop-B)  time(sec)
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         191         196         0
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         192         196         1
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         192         196         2
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         195         195         3
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         196         194         4
...

00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         198         104         78
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         198         103         79
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         198         103         80
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         198         102         81
00:0c:42:64:b1:e6         198         0           82
```

We stop the script on the source node and start it again after one minute with the commands:

```
bash relay-ranks-monitoring.sh DEST_MAC RELAY_A_MAC RELAY_B_MAC batman-relay-b-recovery.csv
```

Finaly, we run this command on Relay B:

```
ebtables -F
```

We can see the ranks of the paths through Relay B recover:

```
  originator(MAC)  rank(hop-A)  rank(hop-B)  time(sec)
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         102         0
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         102         1
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         103         2
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         104         3
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         104         4
...

00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         194         190         63
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         195         191         64
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         193         191         65
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         193         193         66
00:60:b3:25:c0:1b         193         194         67
```

Four CSV files were saved to the "source" node. You can retrieve these files with SCP or with [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh/), and then create a visualization as in the [Results](#results) section.

## Notes

### Protocol versions

This experiment uses B.A.T.M.A.N. version 2017.0.

### How to set up the disk image on another testbed

To set up the `mesh-protocols.ndz` disk image, we used the script in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ffund/2d6972b1f3c77392c80db8018dac0a19).
