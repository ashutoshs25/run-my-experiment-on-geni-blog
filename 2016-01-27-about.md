This site features reproducible experiments that can run on [GENI](https://portal.geni.net/).

GENI is used in a tremendous variety of ways, from cutting edge research on new Internet architectures, to undergraduate projects in distributed systems, to classroom assignments in cognitive radio design. Rather than any single tool or feature of GENI, this site focuses on the multitude of meaningful experiments that it supports. 

This blog is inspired by the [Reproducing Network Research](https://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com) blog. However, while that blog is specifically for research results, this blog also include non-research projects, demonstrations of interesting (known) phenomena in computer networks or wireless systems, and any other kind of experiment - as long as it can be reproduced on GENI.

### How can I contribute a reproducible experiment to this blog?

If you have an experiment that can be reproduced on GENI, you can share it with others by contributing it to this blog. 

To contribute an experiment,

* Write the contents of your blog post in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (Mathjax is also supported.) Include your name and email address.
* Send the Markdown file to witest-group@nyu.edu
* We will send you an email invitation to become an author on the blog.
